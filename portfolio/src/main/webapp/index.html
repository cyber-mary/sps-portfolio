        <h1>Mary Mendoza's Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id = >&emsp;&emsp;Hello! My name is Mary. Welcome to my portfolio. I am a third year at Sacramento State pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science. 
            I am currently a participant in the Google Software Product Sprint; I can’t wait to start working with my project team. I have been involved in the Society of Professional Hispanic Engineers (SHPE) since my freshman year 
            and am currently the communications executive of the Sacramento SHPE chapter. 
            I’m also a member of the Society of Women Engineers. </p>
            <p id = >&emsp;&emsp;I originally learned computer science through a high school program called Empoder, where I learned Java and HTML/CSS from Google software engineers, then taught it to underprivileged middle school girls.
                 I fell in love with coding, it’s like putting together a puzzle and nothing is more satisfying than finishing it. I also love that technology is a great tool for social entrepreneurship. 
                 Social entrepreneurship, as defined by Wikipedia, is “an approach by individuals, groups, start-up companies or entrepreneurs, in which they develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues.” 
                  As a queer Latinx, I hope to one day work at a startup where I can help solve problems that impact LGBTQ or BIPOC communities. I also want help make coding more accessible for all, 
                  so we can have more diversity in technology. </p>
